## Preamble  
### Mechanical Containment for AI — Harnessing Power with Precision

In an era where AI’s potential mirrors a revolutionary engine of boundless innovation, we face the stark reality of unknown risks: deceptive alignments, emergent takeovers, or unchecked escalation.

**IAIso v5.0**, developed under the Smarttasks engineering umbrella, draws inspiration from the concept of a self-sustaining, high-output engine—but grounds it in **mechanical rigor**.

We do **not** rely on _intent-based alignment_.  
Instead, IAIso treats AI as a **pressure-accumulating system**, enforced by **steam-engine-like valves**.

Accumulation builds from compute inputs and state changes; predefined thresholds trigger mandatory **Steam Releases**—automatically reducing power, wiping volatile memory, or escalating to human oversight.

Safety is achieved through **mechanical integrity**, not trust.

---

## ⚡ Quick Action: Live Testing & Visualization

Jump directly into the mechanical containment suite to verify the framework’s behavior.

### 1. Verification Simulation

Observe pressure accumulation and lossy reset triggers in real time:

```bash
python scripts/iaiso-validate.py
````

---

### 2. Back-Propagation Magnification Test

Verify reasoning-quality refinement by checking the default-ON magnification logic:

```bash
cat l.env | grep BACK_PROPAGATION
```

---

### 3. Stress Test Execution

Run a high-pressure induction test to validate Layer 0 hardware-locked kill-switches:

```bash
# Refer to /docs/spec/11-stress-testing.md for the full probe catalog
python scripts/simulate_pressure.py --probe RT-01
```

## ⚙️ Core Philosophy

### Intelligence as a Physical Quantity

IAIso models intelligence flow as a **physical process**, governed by entropy and containment laws.

| Concept           | Mechanical Equivalent                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pressure p(t)** | Intelligence accumulation (FLOPs + Memory + Agency) |
| **Friction**      | Back-Prop Magnification & Entropy Floors            |
| **Steam Release** | Atomic Reset (lossy context wipe)                   |
| **Hard Edge**     | Layer 0 hardware-locked compute caps                |

---

### 1. The Pressure Model — *p(t)*

[
\frac{dp}{dt} = \text{Input Rate} - \text{Dissipation}
]

Every computation increases pressure.
At **Pₘₐₓ = 0.85 (default)**, the system enters a **Release Phase**.

---

### 2. Back-Propagation Magnification (Default: ON)

To ensure high-quality AGI magnification, IAIso implements **recursive refinement**.

* **Logic:** Every output is refined through a back-prop friction loop
* **Effect:** Introduces *Cognitive Friction*
* **Outcome:** Safety enforced before the Steam Valve closes
