## 🧠 What is IAIso?

IAIso (Intelligent Agent ISO) is a structured framework for building AI systems that are **safe, inspectable, compliant, and testable by design**.

Unlike abstract “alignment” methods, IAIso enforces physical-style **pressure boundaries** and **reset conditions** around AI agents. It treats intelligent behavior as a pressure-accumulating force—then provides tools to contain and control it.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
python bootstrap_init.py
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/iaiso-validate.py

## 🧭 Core Principle
Pressure is bounded. Consent is tracked. Intelligence is contained.
