# Q-Algorithm Error Auditor Solution Pack

## Overview
Monitoring quantum state decoherence and audit-logging gate errors.

## Implementation
- **Component**: `components/sol/sol.quantum.audit-v1.json`
- **Template**: `templates/sol/sol.quantum.audit-v1.template`

## Governance
This solution is governed by the **sol.quantum.logic** consent scope. All actions are subject to the IAIso v5.0 5 Core Invariants, including **Back-Propagation Magnification** to ensure CISSP-level safety.
