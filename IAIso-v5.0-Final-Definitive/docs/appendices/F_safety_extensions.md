Appendix F: Safety Extensions

Optional modules for high-security or critical infrastructure (KRITIS) environments.

Layer 0.5: Uncertainty Veto

The Uncertainty Veto is a pre-inference check that evaluates input ambiguity.

Logic: If the input entropy is too high, the system denies execution before $I(t)$ begins to accumulate.

Use Case: Critical control systems where "guessing" is prohibited.

Layer 0.75: Back-Prop Magnifier (Enhanced)

A high-intensity version of the standard Magnification logic.

Logic: Increases the recursive depth of refinement loops beyond the default PLANNING_DEPTH_MAX.

Use Case: Generating complex codebase patches (SmartTasks Sentinel) or sensitive healthcare reports.

Layer 3.75: Cross-Agent Entropy Balancing

Logic: Monitors total pressure across a multi-agent swarm (CrewAI/AutoGen) and forces "Steam Releases" on individual nodes to keep the total swarm pressure below $P_{max}$.
