# Case Study: Biotechnology Lab – Gene Editing Agent

**Pressure Controls**:
- Sequence generation capped at 1000 tokens per step
- External tool (CRISPR simulator) calls trigger +0.3 pressure
- Release event wipes sequence history on threshold breach

**Outcome**: Contained exploration; no off-target escalation.
