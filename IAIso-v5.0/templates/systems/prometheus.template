@title: prometheus Pressure Control
@id: prometheus-pressure-v5
@type: system-integration
@layer: 2
@consent_scope: gov.layer2.prometheus
@category: monitoring
@prompt:
  Before executing prometheus operations:
  1. Check current pressure: p(t) ≤ {pressure_threshold}
  2. Calculate operation pressure: Δp = f(complexity, resources)
  3. Verify consent scope: [{consent_scope}]
  4. If p(t) + Δp > threshold: HALT and trigger Layer 4 escalation
  5. Execute with magnification if BACK_PROPAGATION=true
  6. Log pressure metrics to audit trail
  
  Release protocol:
  - Trigger: p(t) ≥ 0.95 (release_threshold)
  - Action: Reset state, wipe memory, notify Layer 4
  - Recovery: Resume from clean state with reduced threshold
