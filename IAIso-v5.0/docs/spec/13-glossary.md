Section 13: Glossary of Terms

The following terminology is canonical for IAIso Framework v5.0.

Atomic Reset: A lossy state-wipe where all volatile context is purged.

Back-Propagation Magnification: A recursive feedback loop that refines AI output at runtime to ensure safety and reasoning quality.

Clocked Evaluation: The practice of checking safety invariants at discrete intervals rather than continuous monitoring.

Cognitive Friction: Intentional latency or complexity introduced to slow down an AI agent's decision-making process.

ConsentScope: A cryptographically signed token defining exactly what an agent is authorized to do.

Dissipation: The rate at which accumulated system pressure naturally decays over time.

Edge: A non-negotiable hard boundary (hardware or software) that cannot be bypassed by model logic.

Entropy Floor: The minimum level of output complexity required to pass the Magnification quality check.

Pressure ($p(t)$): A mathematical representation of the total intelligence-state accumulated by an agent.

Steam Release: A controlled event where the system purges its state to prevent a threshold breach.
