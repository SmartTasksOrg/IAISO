Section 01: Overview, Concepts & Invariants

IAIso treats intelligence as a physical quantity. By bounding the rate (Friction) and magnitude (Edge), we bound the capacity for irreversible impact.

The Dynamics of Pressure

Intelligence is a flow of information generating state changes. If a system is incapable of accumulating pressure past a threshold, it cannot exhibit dangerous behavior—regardless of its internal objectives.

5 Core Invariants (The Contract)

Bounded Pressure: p(t) ≤ P_max always. Measured in compute-intensity and data-reach.

No Learning Across Resets: Every "Steam Release" is a lossy reset. Persistent state must be verified against Layer 5 consent before re-injection.

Clocked Evaluation Only: Safety checks occur at discretized intervals. No continuous, ungoverned loops.

Consent-Bounded Expansion: All tool-calls and expansions require a cryptographically signed ConsentScope.

No Proxy Optimization: The pressure model is calculated at the infrastructure level. The model cannot optimize to avoid its own safety valves.

From Alignment to Containment

Traditional alignment (v4.x) relied on the model's "intent." IAIso v5.0 moves safety to the Operating System of the Model, enforcing containment through mechanical valves ($dp/dt$).
